# Lagrange Reader

Android client for BookOrbit focused on reading and listening.

## Current scope

- Connect to a user-provided BookOrbit server
- Authenticate through the server login flow
- Browse libraries and books
- Stream supported content
- Download books for offline reading or listening
- Queue progress updates offline and sync them later

## Project status

Working prototype. The app shell, API wiring, local download tracking, sync queue, authenticated-session bootstrap, sign-out/session reset behavior, and EPUB/PDF/audio/CBZ reading paths are in place. The native browser now uses a Plex-inspired Home/Libraries/More bottom bar, a top logo/search/profile bar, a library picker, and a dedicated search layer. The EPUB reader includes Compact, Comfortable, and Wide padding presets, with Comfortable as the default and repagination on change. Focused JVM coverage exercises coordinator bootstrap, cached offline fallback, post-login resume flows, progress restoration, and recoverable browser-load failures. Compose instrumentation coverage now includes setup, login recovery, live/loading browser states, and cached offline behavior. Device testing confirms EPUB download, offline reopen, progress replay, local images, session persistence, and last-session reader restore. Launch visual refinement remains open; other media-specific validation remains deferred until representative samples are available.

## Build

From the project root:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## Test

Run the local JVM unit suite with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest
```

The release build also compiles locally with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease
```

The repository now also includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `testDebugUnitTest`, `lintDebug`, `assembleDebugAndroidTest`, and `assembleDebug` on pushes to `main` and on pull requests.

Server policy: production-style server URLs must use `https://`. Plain `http://` is only accepted for local development targets such as `localhost` and common Android emulator loopback aliases.

## Manual app testing

The current manual test entry point is documented in [docs/testing.md](./docs/testing.md).

Minimum baseline before manual app testing:

- `.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug` passes
- `.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest` passes
- a reachable BookOrbit server is available
- a test account can sign in and access real content

## Local setup

Machine-specific SDK setup and environment notes are in [docs/setup.md](./docs/setup.md).
